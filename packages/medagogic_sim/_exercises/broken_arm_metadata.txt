# Case Summary
A 3-year-old boy is brought to the ED by his mother after a fall from playground equipment. He has an obvious deformity of his left arm, with significant pain and slight swelling. The team will need to assess and manage his pain and stabilize his arm. Once his arm is stabilized and pain controlled, imaging will be needed to assess the extent of the fracture. If not managed promptly, the patient could develop complications such as compartment syndrome or nerve damage. Appropriate treatment will include pain control, possibly sedation, reduction of the fracture if necessary, and immobilization.

# Expected Actions
- Assess and manage the boy's pain immediately
- Perform a detailed physical examination focusing on the affected arm 
- Stabilize the injured arm using a splint or other appropriate method 
- Administer appropriate analgesics for pain relief 
- Order an X-ray of the arm to assess the extent of the fracture
- Evaluate for signs of more serious injury such as neurovascular compromise 
- Consider a procedural sedation if a fracture reduction is needed 
- If a fracture is confirmed, reduce and immobilize the fracture as appropriate
- Consult with orthopedic surgery for further management if required
- Provide the boy and his parents with appropriate follow-up instructions and warning signs of complications.
