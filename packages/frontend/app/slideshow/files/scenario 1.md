**Scenario 1: Neonate with Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)**

- **Age**: 3 days
- **Weight**: 3.5 kg
- **Allergies**: None
- **ABCDE status**: Airway clear, Breathing irregular (periodic breathing), Circulation stable, Disability (clonic movements of one arm), Exposure (birth asphyxia noted).
- **Medical Description**: Neonate presents with focal clonic seizures possibly secondary to hypoxic-ischemic injury during birth.
- **Condition/Cause**: Hypoxic-Ischemic Encephalopathy (HIE)
- **Heart Rate**: 165 bpm
- **Respiratory Rate**: 60 breaths/min
- **Blood Pressure**: 55/30 mmHg (normal range for neonates)
- **Temperature**: 36.5Â°C
- **SpO2**: 88% (critical; action required)
  
  *Simulation Instruction*: After initial IV/intranasal Midazolam, seizures stop but then return stronger. Phenobarbital administration leads to a significant drop in respiratory rate, challenging trainees in managing potential side effects.
