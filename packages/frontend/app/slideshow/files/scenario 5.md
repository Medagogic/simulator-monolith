**Scenario 5: Early-Teen with Unknown Seizure Etiology**

- **Age**: 13 years
- **Weight**: 50 kg
- **Allergies**: Allergic to phenytoin
- **ABCDE status**: Airway clear, Breathing regular, Circulation stable, Disability (absence seizure with intermittent myoclonic jerks), Exposure (no obvious triggers).
- **Medical Description**: The teenager presents with an absence seizure that later progressed to involve myoclonic jerks, with no identifiable etiology on initial assessment.
- **Condition/Cause**: Juvenile Myoclonic Epilepsy (JME)
- **Heart Rate**: 105 bpm
- **Respiratory Rate**: 20 breaths/min
- **Blood Pressure**: 110/70 mmHg
- **Temperature**: 37.3Â°C
- **SpO2**: 96%

  *Simulation Instruction*: Seizure activity diminishes after IV Midazolam but doesn't stop. Second-line treatment with an antiseizure medication other than phenytoin or Fosphenytoin should be considered due to the known allergy. After administration, simulate brief respiratory depression, testing trainees' skills in managing this complication.
